Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of NumPy for computation and SciPy for linear algebra operations on two arrays. The focus is on three key areas: general linear algebra operations, permutation techniques, and LU decomposition.

NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, provides powerful tools for array manipulation and basic computations. SciPy's linear algebra module builds upon NumPy, offering specialized routines for advanced linear algebra operations.

In this project, we utilize these libraries to perform:

1. Linear Algebra Operations: Exploring matrix operations, transformations, and solutions to linear systems using SciPy's linear algebra module.

2. Permutation Techniques: Implementing and analyzing various permutation methods on our arrays, showcasing the computational capabilities of NumPy in handling array rearrangements.

3. LU Decomposition: Applying the Lower-Upper (LU) decomposition method to factorize our matrices, demonstrating how this technique can be used to solve linear systems efficiently and compute determinants.
